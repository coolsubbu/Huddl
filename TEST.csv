"the ladwp, which is not governed by the iso, needs 3,800 megawatts of power to serve its customers",ACTIONABLE
"the iso, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state no matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency, which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%",ACTIONABLE
"the iso warned federal regulators, generators and utilities wednesday during a conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency wednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts",ACTIONABLE
a stage three is declared when the iso's operating reserves fall to less than .5% and power is interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing,ACTIONABLE
but iso spokesman patrick dorinson said it would call a stage three only as a means of attracting aitional electricity resources,ACTIONABLE
(pcg) unit pacific gas & electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of the high-priced power,ACTIONABLE
it's still unclear whether retail customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity rates or if companies will absorb the costs,ACTIONABLE
"as previously reported, the iso told utilities and the federal energy regulatory commission wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert at 5 pm pst (0100 gmt thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would dip below .5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid collapse",ACTIONABLE
"the iso wednesday called a stage 2 power emergency for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be called on to do so",ACTIONABLE
"the iso has asked aes to return its off line plants to operations, but aes has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the company $20 million for polluting",ACTIONABLE

"closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes",ACTIONABLE
"most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging a sort of price insurance that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared",ACTIONABLE

wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per thousand cubic feet a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile to drill for gas,ACTIONABLE
"by spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter",ACTIONABLE
"but if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to know much about gas or whatever commodity they're trading",ACTIONABLE
that leverage as to their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time,ACTIONABLE
utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter,ACTIONABLE
but some utility executives didn't share that view,ACTIONABLE
just passing through some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers,ACTIONABLE
"sheila lumpe, chairwoman of the missouri public service commission, said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve energy",ACTIONABLE
it waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs,ACTIONABLE
now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills,ACTIONABLE
and regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs,ACTIONABLE

attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials jeff dasovich and i prepared,ACTIONABLE
the gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees,ACTIONABLE
"he also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of california consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power (which he estimates at 3000mw)",ACTIONABLE
he foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by '02 and provide some political cover,ACTIONABLE
"he seemed interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a goal of x000 mw of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate analysts and other ""nonadvocates"" to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities",ACTIONABLE
state may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a "couple" of generation plants,ACTIONABLE
the gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases,ACTIONABLE
utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus basis to consumers,ACTIONABLE
take state lands gas royalties in kind,ACTIONABLE
empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time,ACTIONABLE
condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state,ACTIONABLE
either eliminate the iso or sharply curtail its function he wants to hear more about how nordpool works(jeff- someone in schroeder's group should be able to help out here),ACTIONABLE
we made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators,ACTIONABLE
thoughts and get them to kari) he wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload not just the 5 one year strips,ACTIONABLE
he would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal,ACTIONABLE
he wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues,ACTIONABLE

bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8th deadline due to lackof support sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for thebond issuance/bridge loan by the may 8th deadline,ACTIONABLE
"however, it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place",ACTIONABLE
"sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8th, having a bond issuance by july 1st will be very difficult",ACTIONABLE
"however, sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen, currently in ab 8x",ACTIONABLE
"senator bowen's language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy). according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature, republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund",ACTIONABLE
" key points of the bridge financing lehman brothers$.0 b bear stearns$625 m tax-exempt rate.77% current projected for more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510 bill sb 6x passed the senate yesterday, but little can be done at this time the senate passed sb 6x yesterday, which authorizes $5 billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority",ACTIONABLE
"without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor has negotiated, the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support",ACTIONABLE
"according to sources, the state has yet to sign the mou with socal, though socal has signed it",ACTIONABLE
the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass,ACTIONABLE
"if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou, socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash",ACTIONABLE
" the second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond issuance, would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31x (bridge loan) stating that the dwr would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, then the utilities would receive the residual amount",ACTIONABLE
"if this language is included and passed by the legislature, it appears likely that socal will likely file forbankruptcy",ACTIONABLE

"closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes",ACTIONABLE
"most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging a sort of price insurance that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared",ACTIONABLE
"""there's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to change,"" said ed krapels, director of gas power services for energy security analysis inc., an energy consulting firm in wakefield, mass",ACTIONABLE

wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per thousand cubic feet a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile to drill for gas,ACTIONABLE
"by spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter",ACTIONABLE
"but if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to know much about gas or whatever commodity they're trading",ACTIONABLE
that leverage as to their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time,ACTIONABLE
utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter,ACTIONABLE

just passing through some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers,ACTIONABLE
"sheila lumpe, chairwoman of the missouri public service commission, said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve energy",ACTIONABLE
it waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs,ACTIONABLE
now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills,ACTIONABLE

"he also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of california consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power (which he estimates at 3000mw)",ACTIONABLE
he foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by '02 and provide some political cover,ACTIONABLE
"he seemed interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a goal of x000 mw of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate analysts and other ""nonadvocates"" to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities",ACTIONABLE
state may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a "couple" of generation plants,ACTIONABLE

"unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to creekside builders, llc",ACTIONABLE
"with a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately .25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees",ACTIONABLE

"the general partner will contract with creekside builders, llc to construct the units and the fee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs",ACTIONABLE
"for example, if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership",ACTIONABLE

"the third quarter restructuring charge includes severance costs for the elimination of approximately 6,100 jobs and asset impairment and other costs, all relating to the consolidation and reorganization of certain business units, the scale back of corporate lending in certain regions, the migration of certain processes to lower cost locations, the outsourcing of certain activities, and the transition of certain processing and service functions to the internet",ACTIONABLE

aefa results reflect continued weakness in equity markets and narrower spreads on the investment portfolio,ACTIONABLE
the reduction reflects the activities to date to lower the risk profile of the portfolio and concentrate on stronger credits,ACTIONABLE
"consequently, these costs did not impact aeb's quarterly results",ACTIONABLE
"these were offset in part by higher provisions for losses due to higher personal financial services loan balances, and lower revenue from corporate banking as the company continues to shift its focus to personal financial services and private banking",ACTIONABLE
"factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, thnt and types of investment products sold by aefa, the market value of its managed assets, and management and distribution fees received based on thoseassets; potential deterioration in the high-yield sector and other investment areas, which could result in further losses in aefa's investment portfolio; the ability of aefa to sell certain high- yield investments at expected values and within anticipated time frames and to maintain its high-yield portfolio at certain levels in the future; developments relating to aefa's new platform structure for financial advisors, including the ability to increase advisor productivity, moderate the growth of new advisors and create efficiencies in the infrastructure; aefa's ability to effectively manage the economics in selling a growing volume of non-proprietary products to clients; investment performance in aefa's businesses; the success, timeliness and financial impact, including costs, cost savings and other benefits, of reengineering initiatives being implemented or considered by the company, including cost management, structural and strategic measures such as vendor, process, facilities and operations consolidation, outsourcing, relocating certain functions to lower cost overseas locations, moving internal and external functions to the internet to save costs, the scale back of corporate lending in certain regions, and planned staff reductions relating to certainof such reengineering actions; the ability to control and manage operating, infrastructure, advertising and promotion and other expenses as business expands or changes, including balancing the need for longer term investmentspending; the company's ability to recover under its insurance policies for losses resulting from the september 11th terrorist attacks; consumer and business spending on the company's travel related services products, particularly credit and charge cards and growth in card lending balances, which depend in part on the ability to issue new and enhanced card products and increase revenues from such products, attract new cardholders, capture a greater share of existing cardholders' spending, sustain premium discount rates, increase merchant coverage, retain cardmembers after low introductory lending rates have expired, and expand the global network services business; successfully expanding the company's on-line and off-line distribution channels and cross-selling financial, travel, card and other products and services to its customer base, both in the u.s",ACTIONABLE

each of the individual investors and all of the principals in creekside would also personally guarantee the loans,ACTIONABLE
"unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to creekside builders, llc",ACTIONABLE
"with a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately .25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees",ACTIONABLE
"equity at improvement loan once the site plan is approved by the city of austin, the city will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the ""fiscals""",ACTIONABLE
"this would produce a loan amount of $15,000 on $20,000 per lot",ACTIONABLE
"even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent",ACTIONABLE
"the engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement",ACTIONABLE
"the improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land",ACTIONABLE
"this would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,00",ACTIONABLE
we expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer,ACTIONABLE
"we do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process",ACTIONABLE
"the general partner will contract with creekside builders, llc to construct the units and the fee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs",ACTIONABLE
"for example, if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership",ACTIONABLE

"the iso wednesday called a stage 2 power emergency for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be called on to do so",ACTIONABLE

attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials jeff dasovich and i prepared,ACTIONABLE
the gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees,ACTIONABLE
"he also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of california consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power (which he estimates at 3000mw)",ACTIONABLE
he foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by '02 and provide some political cover,ACTIONABLE
"he seemed interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a goal of x000 mw of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate analysts and other ""nonadvocates"" to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities",ACTIONABLE
state may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a "couple" of generation plants,ACTIONABLE
the gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases,ACTIONABLE
utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus basis to consumers,ACTIONABLE
take state lands gas royalties in kind,ACTIONABLE
empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time,ACTIONABLE
condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state,ACTIONABLE
either eliminate the iso or sharply curtail its function he wants to hear more about how nordpool works(jeff- someone in schroeder's group should be able to help out here),ACTIONABLE
we made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators,ACTIONABLE
thoughts and get them to kari) he wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload not just the 5 one year strips,ACTIONABLE
he would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal,ACTIONABLE
he wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues,ACTIONABLE
where did you get these amounts,ACTIONABLE
do not evict this tenant for being unclean!,ACTIONABLE
that will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money and time remodeling,ACTIONABLE
i would rather try and deal with this tenant by first asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like leaky pipes,ACTIONABLE
"if that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the apartment and charge them for the labor",ACTIONABLE
then we will perform monthly inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property,ACTIONABLE
"this tenant has been here since september 1998, i don't want to run them off",ACTIONABLE

"traders put the two together, anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights",ACTIONABLE
"he had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality",ACTIONABLE
"""it's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what we are reporting,"" mcgill said",ACTIONABLE
"closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes",ACTIONABLE
"most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging a sort of price insurance that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared",ACTIONABLE
"""there's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to change,"" said ed krapels, director of gas power services for energy security analysis inc., an energy consulting firm in wakefield, mass",ACTIONABLE
"the sunday collection is down, said fraser, who might have to forgo part of his salary",ACTIONABLE
wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per thousand cubic feet a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile to drill for gas,ACTIONABLE
"by spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter",ACTIONABLE
"but if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to know much about gas or whatever commodity they're trading",ACTIONABLE
that leverage as to their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time,ACTIONABLE
utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter,ACTIONABLE
but some utility executives didn't share that view,ACTIONABLE
just passing through some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers,ACTIONABLE
"sheila lumpe, chairwoman of the missouri public service commission, said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve energy",ACTIONABLE
it waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs,ACTIONABLE
now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills,ACTIONABLE
and regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs,ACTIONABLE
"on friday, doug micheel, senior counsel of the missouri office of the public counsel, said his office would ask the missouri public service commission to perform an emergency audit of missouri gas energy's gas purchasing practices",ACTIONABLE

"we cannot have the learner calculate p&l on storage costs, transportation costs, or hedging instruments",ACTIONABLE
i believe these tasks will be actually better if we don't have the learner calculate p&l because he has already calculated p&l numerous times in the structurer/customer scenarios and conversion and arbitrage scenarios,ACTIONABLE
we cannot export price numbers into excel because the indeliq framework does not support the downloading of data into external applications,ACTIONABLE

"sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8th, having a bond issuance by july 1st will be very difficult",ACTIONABLE
"however, sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen, currently in ab 8x",ACTIONABLE
"senator bowen's language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy). according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature, republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund",ACTIONABLE

"without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor has negotiated, the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support",ACTIONABLE
"according to sources, the state has yet to sign the mou with socal, though socal has signed it",ACTIONABLE
the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass,ACTIONABLE
"if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou, socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash",ACTIONABLE
" the second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond issuance, would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31x (bridge loan) stating that the dwr would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, then the utilities would receive the residual amount",ACTIONABLE

"your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., march 2001 vs",NON-ACTIONABLE
march 2000) was absolutely correct,NON-ACTIONABLE
"at this point, it appears that demand over the last 12 months in the caiso control area, after adjusting for temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%",NON-ACTIONABLE
"this translates into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 mwa for last month (march 2001) as compared with the previous year",NON-ACTIONABLE
"looking forward into the summer, i believe that we will see further voluntary reductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts)",NON-ACTIONABLE
"other forecasters (e.g., pira) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 mwa (making total year-on-year reduction 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in june",NON-ACTIONABLE
"this scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand",NON-ACTIONABLE
"given that the 6% decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, i think that it is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last year",NON-ACTIONABLE
"note that all the numbers i am reporting here are for the caiso control area only, which represents about 89% of total calif load, or 36-37% of wscc (u.s.) summer load",NON-ACTIONABLE
"i think it is reasonable to assume that the non-iso portion of calif (i.e., ladwp and iid) will see similar reductions in demand",NON-ACTIONABLE
"as for the rest of the wscc, that is a much more difficult call",NON-ACTIONABLE
"as you are aware, the pacific nw has already seen about 2,000 mwa of aluminum smelter load come off since dec, and this load is expected to stay off at least through sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if bpa gets its wish)",NON-ACTIONABLE
this figure represents approx 4% of the non-calif wscc,NON-ACTIONABLE
several mining operations in the sw and rockies have recently announced that they are sharply curtailing production,NON-ACTIONABLE
"while the rest of the wscc may not see the 10%+ reductions that i am expecting in calif, i think we could easily expect an aitional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 mwa, of further demand reduction in the non-calif wscc for this summer",NON-ACTIONABLE
"this would bring the total reduction for the wscc, including the 2,000 mwa aluminum load we have already seen, to around 6,500-7,000 mwa when compared with last summer",NON-ACTIONABLE

" by steve everly - the kansas city star as natural gas prices rose in december, traders at the new york mercantile exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas storage number",NON-ACTIONABLE
"the storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the forecast was for frigid weather",NON-ACTIONABLE
"""traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said william burson, a trader",NON-ACTIONABLE
"""it makes the market for natural gas."" but the market's response perplexed chris mcgill, the american gas association's director of gas supply and transportation",NON-ACTIONABLE
"as consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons and culprits is on",NON-ACTIONABLE
some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at wall street,NON-ACTIONABLE
"stephen adik, senior vice president of the indiana utility nisource, recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for the rise in gas prices",NON-ACTIONABLE
"""it's my firm belief ",NON-ACTIONABLE
"that today's gas prices are being manipulated,"" adik told the trade magazine public utilities fortnightly",NON-ACTIONABLE
"in california, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry",NON-ACTIONABLE
"""we're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said paul snider, a spokesman for missouri gas energy",NON-ACTIONABLE
but critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers,NON-ACTIONABLE
"hot topic many circles, little else is discussed",NON-ACTIONABLE
"vincent fraser of glad tidings assembly of god in kansas city is facing a $1,456 december bill for heating the church more than double the previous december's bill",NON-ACTIONABLE

"for the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating",NON-ACTIONABLE
"""it's the talk of the town here,"" he said",NON-ACTIONABLE
a year ago that wasn't a fear,NON-ACTIONABLE
utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers,NON-ACTIONABLE

"there was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded",NON-ACTIONABLE
"by early november, prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet",NON-ACTIONABLE
the federal energy information administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher,NON-ACTIONABLE
but $10 gas was coming,NON-ACTIONABLE
"below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, including the kansas city area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets",NON-ACTIONABLE
"""it's all about the weather,"" said krapels of energy security analysis",NON-ACTIONABLE
"wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the new york traders",NON-ACTIONABLE
natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile commodity in the world,NON-ACTIONABLE
"setting the price in the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas, allowing it to float",NON-ACTIONABLE
"in 1990, the new york mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices",NON-ACTIONABLE
the futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years,NON-ACTIONABLE
suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce,NON-ACTIONABLE
"and big gas consumers, from utilities to companies such as farmland industries inc., can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use",NON-ACTIONABLE
there are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas and often with little real knowledge of natural gas,NON-ACTIONABLE
"like all futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit",NON-ACTIONABLE
"as december began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than $7 per thousand cubic feet",NON-ACTIONABLE
by the end of the month it was nearly $1,NON-ACTIONABLE
much of the spark for the rally came from the american gas association's weekly storage numbers,NON-ACTIONABLE
"going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop",NON-ACTIONABLE
"still, the american gas association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient",NON-ACTIONABLE
"but when below-normal temperatures arrived in november, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient",NON-ACTIONABLE
then the american gas association reported the lowest year-end storage numbers since they were first published in 199,NON-ACTIONABLE
"still, said the association's mcgill, there was sufficient gas in storage",NON-ACTIONABLE
"william eliason, vice president of kansas gas service, said that if december's cold snap had continued into january, there could have been a real problem meeting demand",NON-ACTIONABLE

"among area utilities, kansas gas service increased its customers' cost-of-gas charge earlier this month to $.68 per thousand cubic feet",NON-ACTIONABLE
"and missouri gas energy has requested an increase to $.81, to begin wednesday",NON-ACTIONABLE
"kansas gas service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to save an average customer about $25 this winter",NON-ACTIONABLE

"your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., march 2001 vs",NON-ACTIONABLE
march 2000) was absolutely correct,NON-ACTIONABLE
"at this point, it appears that demand over the last 12 months in the caiso control area, after adjusting for temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%",NON-ACTIONABLE
"this translates into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 mwa for last month (march 2001) as compared with the previous year",NON-ACTIONABLE
"looking forward into the summer, i believe that we will see further voluntary reductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts)",NON-ACTIONABLE
"other forecasters (e.g., pira) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 mwa (making total year-on-year reduction 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in june",NON-ACTIONABLE
"this scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand",NON-ACTIONABLE
"given that the 6% decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, i think that it is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last year",NON-ACTIONABLE
"note that all the numbers i am reporting here are for the caiso control area only, which represents about 89% of total calif load, or 36-37% of wscc (u.s.) summer load",NON-ACTIONABLE
"i think it is reasonable to assume that the non-iso portion of calif (i.e., ladwp and iid) will see similar reductions in demand",NON-ACTIONABLE
"as for the rest of the wscc, that is a much more difficult call",NON-ACTIONABLE
"as you are aware, the pacific nw has already seen about 2,000 mwa of aluminum smelter load come off since dec, and this load is expected to stay off at least through sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if bpa gets its wish)",NON-ACTIONABLE
this figure represents approx 4% of the non-calif wscc,NON-ACTIONABLE
several mining operations in the sw and rockies have recently announced that they are sharply curtailing production,NON-ACTIONABLE
"while the rest of the wscc may not see the 10%+ reductions that i am expecting in calif, i think we could easily expect an aitional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 mwa, of further demand reduction in the non-calif wscc for this summer",NON-ACTIONABLE

much of the spark for the rally came from the american gas association's weekly storage numbers,NON-ACTIONABLE

phasing works as follows,NON-ACTIONABLE
"if the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot",NON-ACTIONABLE
"of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost",NON-ACTIONABLE
"the land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which i would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot",NON-ACTIONABLE
"then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot",NON-ACTIONABLE

this appears to be the relevant section if the psa is to be paid in shares,NON-ACTIONABLE
aitionally the q & a section in the plan brochure (pg,NON-ACTIONABLE
8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value,NON-ACTIONABLE
this is the methodology described in section ,NON-ACTIONABLE
tom martin and scott neal share the above concerns,NON-ACTIONABLE
"phillip original message for purposes of an accelerated distribution from the psa, a ""single sum distribution,"" in section .2 means that a psa account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement",NON-ACTIONABLE
section .2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee receives the written request of the participant,NON-ACTIONABLE
a psa account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock,NON-ACTIONABLE
"aitionally, any portion of a psa balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under sections .5 and .6 and exhibit a of the plan",NON-ACTIONABLE
this section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of psa balances created with deferrals of restricted stock,NON-ACTIONABLE
"the plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election",NON-ACTIONABLE
therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan,NON-ACTIONABLE

"as shown in the table at the bottom right of this week's edition of the outlook, at the two-month point in the recoveries from the nine former bear markets since world war ii, the s&p 500 had won back an average of 33% of the bear market loss",NON-ACTIONABLE

 section .3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum distribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% penalty,NON-ACTIONABLE
this provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision of the plan,NON-ACTIONABLE
it also states that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee receives the written request of the participant,NON-ACTIONABLE
in my case this would be asof september 30th,NON-ACTIONABLE
"their reading yields a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the phantom stock account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of enron corp",NON-ACTIONABLE
"shares in the account as of september 30, 200",NON-ACTIONABLE
their justification is that in several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated that the distributions of the phantom stock account shall be made in shares of enron corp,NON-ACTIONABLE
there are two reason that i do not agree with their interpretation,NON-ACTIONABLE
"first,section .3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the plan."" this indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other sections of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do not apply",NON-ACTIONABLE
"second, the language in section .3 stating ""a single sum distribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one payment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution",NON-ACTIONABLE
the interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section ,NON-ACTIONABLE
if that is the case then section .1 should apply,NON-ACTIONABLE
this section does provide for the phantom stock account to be paid in shares,NON-ACTIONABLE
"however, it states ""the value of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closing price of enron corp",NON-ACTIONABLE
"common stock on the january 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of enron corp common stock"".this would result in approximately .3 shares to be distributed for everyshare in the account on january 1, 200",NON-ACTIONABLE
although this would be the most beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of enron corp,NON-ACTIONABLE
"common stock from $83 to $10 per share, this methodology goes beyond section ",NON-ACTIONABLE
"the calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method ofsection .3plan administratorssection .1 number of shares,600shares,600shares,600 shares relative share price$2.23$8.13 phantom stock value$179,718$548,658 10% penalty-17,972 -600-54,866 value to be distributed$161,746,000 shares$493,792 current stock price$10 distribution$161,746,000 shares,379 shares i believe my interpretation under section .3 is correct and fair",NON-ACTIONABLE
if the administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7.1 should apply,NON-ACTIONABLE

sorry for all of the changes but there was a scheduling problem with a couple of people for the original time slot,NON-ACTIONABLE
the general partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction,NON-ACTIONABLE
"land ownership & loans the property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership",NON-ACTIONABLE
"if the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced",NON-ACTIONABLE
"all loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans",NON-ACTIONABLE
"if we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse",NON-ACTIONABLE
"use of initial investment the initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals",NON-ACTIONABLE
these professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period,NON-ACTIONABLE
"early land costs the $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing",NON-ACTIONABLE
"as an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value",NON-ACTIONABLE
this cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that coa considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by coa,NON-ACTIONABLE
this release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion,NON-ACTIONABLE
releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction,NON-ACTIONABLE
these fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit,NON-ACTIONABLE
"as such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent",NON-ACTIONABLE
because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds,NON-ACTIONABLE
"the lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which i suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,00",NON-ACTIONABLE
"with estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity",NON-ACTIONABLE
the investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs,NON-ACTIONABLE
"thus, the aitional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,00",NON-ACTIONABLE
the higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side,NON-ACTIONABLE
phasing works as follows,NON-ACTIONABLE
"if the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot",NON-ACTIONABLE
"of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost",NON-ACTIONABLE
"the land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which i would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot",NON-ACTIONABLE
"then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot",NON-ACTIONABLE
this was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the civil engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint,NON-ACTIONABLE
construction loans there are three types of construction loans,NON-ACTIONABLE

"as december began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than $7 per thousand cubic feet",NON-ACTIONABLE

much of the spark for the rally came from the american gas association's weekly storage numbers,NON-ACTIONABLE
"going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop",NON-ACTIONABLE

"your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., march 2001 vs",NON-ACTIONABLE
march 2000) was absolutely correct,NON-ACTIONABLE
"at this point, it appears that demand over the last 12 months in the caiso control area, after adjusting for temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%",NON-ACTIONABLE
"this translates into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 mwa for last month (march 2001) as compared with the previous year",NON-ACTIONABLE
"looking forward into the summer, i believe that we will see further voluntary reductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts)",NON-ACTIONABLE
"other forecasters (e.g., pira) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 mwa (making total year-on-year reduction 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in june",NON-ACTIONABLE
"this scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand",NON-ACTIONABLE
"given that the 6% decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, i think that it is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last year",NON-ACTIONABLE
"note that all the numbers i am reporting here are for the caiso control area only, which represents about 89% of total calif load, or 36-37% of wscc (u.s.) summer load",NON-ACTIONABLE
"i think it is reasonable to assume that the non-iso portion of calif (i.e., ladwp and iid) will see similar reductions in demand",NON-ACTIONABLE
"as for the rest of the wscc, that is a much more difficult call",NON-ACTIONABLE
"as you are aware, the pacific nw has already seen about 2,000 mwa of aluminum smelter load come off since dec, and this load is expected to stay off at least through sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if bpa gets its wish)",NON-ACTIONABLE
this figure represents approx 4% of the non-calif wscc,NON-ACTIONABLE
several mining operations in the sw and rockies have recently announced that they are sharply curtailing production,NON-ACTIONABLE
"while the rest of the wscc may not see the 10%+ reductions that i am expecting in calif, i think we could easily expect an aitional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 mwa, of further demand reduction in the non-calif wscc for this summer",NON-ACTIONABLE

this looks complicated,NON-ACTIONABLE
 section .3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum distribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% penalty,NON-ACTIONABLE
this provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision of the plan,NON-ACTIONABLE
it also states that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee receives the written request of the participant,NON-ACTIONABLE
in my case this would be asof september 30th,NON-ACTIONABLE
"their reading yields a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the phantom stock account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of enron corp",NON-ACTIONABLE
"shares in the account as of september 30, 200",NON-ACTIONABLE
their justification is that in several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated that the distributions of the phantom stock account shall be made in shares of enron corp,NON-ACTIONABLE
there are two reason that i do not agree with their interpretation,NON-ACTIONABLE
"first,section .3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the plan."" this indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other sections of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do not apply",NON-ACTIONABLE
"second, the language in section .3 stating ""a single sum distribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one payment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution",NON-ACTIONABLE
the interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section ,NON-ACTIONABLE
if that is the case then section .1 should apply,NON-ACTIONABLE
this section does provide for the phantom stock account to be paid in shares,NON-ACTIONABLE
"however, it states ""the value of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closing price of enron corp",NON-ACTIONABLE
"common stock on the january 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of enron corp common stock"".this would result in approximately .3 shares to be distributed for everyshare in the account on january 1, 200",NON-ACTIONABLE
although this would be the most beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of enron corp,NON-ACTIONABLE
"common stock from $83 to $10 per share, this methodology goes beyond section ",NON-ACTIONABLE
"the calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method ofsection .3plan administratorssection .1 number of shares,600shares,600shares,600 shares relative share price$2.23$8.13 phantom stock value$179,718$548,658 10% penalty-17,972 -600-54,866 value to be distributed$161,746,000 shares$493,792 current stock price$10 distribution$161,746,000 shares,379 shares i believe my interpretation under section .3 is correct and fair",NON-ACTIONABLE
if the administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7.1 should apply,NON-ACTIONABLE
the current interpretation of the plan administrators is a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout,NON-ACTIONABLE

section .2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee receives the written request of the participant,NON-ACTIONABLE

" greg, after making an election in october to receive a full distribution of my deferral account under section .3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen regarding the phantom stock account",NON-ACTIONABLE
 section .3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum distribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% penalty,NON-ACTIONABLE
this provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision of the plan,NON-ACTIONABLE
it also states that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee receives the written request of the participant,NON-ACTIONABLE
in my case this would be asof september 30th,NON-ACTIONABLE
"their reading yields a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the phantom stock account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of enron corp",NON-ACTIONABLE
"shares in the account as of september 30, 200",NON-ACTIONABLE
their justification is that in several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated that the distributions of the phantom stock account shall be made in shares of enron corp,NON-ACTIONABLE
there are two reason that i do not agree with their interpretation,NON-ACTIONABLE
"first,section .3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the plan."" this indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other sections of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do not apply",NON-ACTIONABLE
"second, the language in section .3 stating ""a single sum distribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one payment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution",NON-ACTIONABLE
the interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section ,NON-ACTIONABLE
if that is the case then section .1 should apply,NON-ACTIONABLE
this section does provide for the phantom stock account to be paid in shares,NON-ACTIONABLE
"however, it states ""the value of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closing price of enron corp",NON-ACTIONABLE
"common stock on the january 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of enron corp common stock"".this would result in approximately .3 shares to be distributed for everyshare in the account on january 1, 200",NON-ACTIONABLE
although this would be the most beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of enron corp,NON-ACTIONABLE
"common stock from $83 to $10 per share, this methodology goes beyond section ",NON-ACTIONABLE
"the calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method ofsection .3plan administratorssection .1 number of shares,600shares,600shares,600 shares relative share price$2.23$8.13 phantom stock value$179,718$548,658 10% penalty-17,972 -600-54,866 value to be distributed$161,746,000 shares$493,792 current stock price$10 distribution$161,746,000 shares,379 shares i believe my interpretation under section .3 is correct and fair",NON-ACTIONABLE
if the administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7.1 should apply,NON-ACTIONABLE
the current interpretation of the plan administrators is a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout,NON-ACTIONABLE

clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor,NON-ACTIONABLE
"aitionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the bond issuance happen by july 1, 200",NON-ACTIONABLE
"if not, the state may be in breach of contract",NON-ACTIONABLE

"aitionally, lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan",NON-ACTIONABLE

"your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., march 2001 vs",NON-ACTIONABLE
march 2000) was absolutely correct,NON-ACTIONABLE
"at this point, it appears that demand over the last 12 months in the caiso control area, after adjusting for temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%",NON-ACTIONABLE
"this translates into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 mwa for last month (march 2001) as compared with the previous year",NON-ACTIONABLE
"looking forward into the summer, i believe that we will see further voluntary reductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts)",NON-ACTIONABLE
"other forecasters (e.g., pira) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 mwa (making total year-on-year reduction 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in june",NON-ACTIONABLE
"this scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand",NON-ACTIONABLE
"given that the 6% decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, i think that it is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last year",NON-ACTIONABLE
"note that all the numbers i am reporting here are for the caiso control area only, which represents about 89% of total calif load, or 36-37% of wscc (u.s.) summer load",NON-ACTIONABLE
"i think it is reasonable to assume that the non-iso portion of calif (i.e., ladwp and iid) will see similar reductions in demand",NON-ACTIONABLE
"as for the rest of the wscc, that is a much more difficult call",NON-ACTIONABLE
"as you are aware, the pacific nw has already seen about 2,000 mwa of aluminum smelter load come off since dec, and this load is expected to stay off at least through sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if bpa gets its wish)",NON-ACTIONABLE
this figure represents approx 4% of the non-calif wscc,NON-ACTIONABLE
several mining operations in the sw and rockies have recently announced that they are sharply curtailing production,NON-ACTIONABLE
"while the rest of the wscc may not see the 10%+ reductions that i am expecting in calif, i think we could easily expect an aitional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 mwa, of further demand reduction in the non-calif wscc for this summer",NON-ACTIONABLE

"land ownership & loans the property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership",NON-ACTIONABLE
"if the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced",NON-ACTIONABLE
"all loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans",NON-ACTIONABLE
"if we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse",NON-ACTIONABLE
"use of initial investment the initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals",NON-ACTIONABLE
these professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period,NON-ACTIONABLE
"early land costs the $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing",NON-ACTIONABLE
"as an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value",NON-ACTIONABLE
this cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that coa considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by coa,NON-ACTIONABLE
this release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion,NON-ACTIONABLE
releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction,NON-ACTIONABLE
these fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit,NON-ACTIONABLE
"as such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent",NON-ACTIONABLE
because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds,NON-ACTIONABLE
"the lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which i suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,00",NON-ACTIONABLE
"with estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity",NON-ACTIONABLE
the investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs,NON-ACTIONABLE
"thus, the aitional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,00",NON-ACTIONABLE
the higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side,NON-ACTIONABLE
phasing works as follows,NON-ACTIONABLE
"if the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot",NON-ACTIONABLE
"of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost",NON-ACTIONABLE
"the land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which i would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot",NON-ACTIONABLE
"then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot",NON-ACTIONABLE
this was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the civil engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint,NON-ACTIONABLE
construction loans there are three types of construction loans,NON-ACTIONABLE
"first, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity",NON-ACTIONABLE
"second, is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name",NON-ACTIONABLE
"third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer",NON-ACTIONABLE

"the storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the forecast was for frigid weather",NON-ACTIONABLE
"""traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said william burson, a trader",NON-ACTIONABLE
"""it makes the market for natural gas."" but the market's response perplexed chris mcgill, the american gas association's director of gas supply and transportation",NON-ACTIONABLE
"as consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons and culprits is on",NON-ACTIONABLE
some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at wall street,NON-ACTIONABLE

there are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas and often with little real knowledge of natural gas,NON-ACTIONABLE
"like all futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit",NON-ACTIONABLE
"as december began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than $7 per thousand cubic feet",NON-ACTIONABLE
by the end of the month it was nearly $1,NON-ACTIONABLE
much of the spark for the rally came from the american gas association's weekly storage numbers,NON-ACTIONABLE
"going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop",NON-ACTIONABLE
"still, the american gas association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient",NON-ACTIONABLE
"but when below-normal temperatures arrived in november, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient",NON-ACTIONABLE

"he pointed out an anomalous pricing occurence in the options market, a market i normally don't follow closely, that i translated into a multimillion dollar trade for enron",NON-ACTIONABLE
i want to emphasize that continuing this relationship should be considered a high priority,NON-ACTIONABLE
i am willing to accept some of the credit risk exposure as a cost of doing business,NON-ACTIONABLE
bill understands his role as an independent in the market and performs the right risk/reward trades for someone with finite capital,NON-ACTIONABLE

this was one product,NON-ACTIONABLE
our spread options are booked in excel using option pricing models created by the research group,NON-ACTIONABLE
the problem with these models is that they are strictly theoretical and don't take into account gas fundamental price limitations,NON-ACTIONABLE
"for instance, it is less probable, though not impossible, for a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within variable cost than the models predict",NON-ACTIONABLE
"obviously, we have this function in our pricing models",NON-ACTIONABLE
i was not aware this methodology had not been transferred to the valuation models,NON-ACTIONABLE
this has since been changed,NON-ACTIONABLE
fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as very few non-investment grade companies trade these types of products,NON-ACTIONABLE

the below file shows the results of the two stress test requested,NON-ACTIONABLE
"under the $7 dollar stress, nymex curve was shifted to $7 dollars with all other price curves proportionally shifted",NON-ACTIONABLE
"under the $9 dollar test, not only were the price curves shifted, but volatilites were stressed as well with nymex volatility going to 100% and all other vol locations being raised accordingly",NON-ACTIONABLE
"$7 dollar stress only raised var by 79% $9 dollar stress raised var by 134% it is interesting to note that with the seven dollar stress, var on the financial desk actually decreased",NON-ACTIONABLE
"this would seem to imply that up to the seven dollar strike, the financial desk is long gamma (which overall reduces risk)",NON-ACTIONABLE
"but between the seven dollar and nine dollar strike, it appears that the desk becomes short gamma, thereby acceralatering the amount of risk and increasing var by 74%",NON-ACTIONABLE
frank attached below are the $7 and $9 stresses that were run at the request of lavo ($7) and arnold ($9),NON-ACTIONABLE

 sorry for my cryptic answer in regards to the lng deal on friday; i was a bit confused by the question,NON-ACTIONABLE
"in terms of the gas pricing, this is a deal that should be done",NON-ACTIONABLE
market conditions are very conducive to hedging a fair amount of the gas,NON-ACTIONABLE
"obviously, a deal this size would require enron to wear a considerable amount of the risk in the short term, but the risk-reward of the position looks very favorable",NON-ACTIONABLE
i am certainly willing to sign off on this deal around the $.00 level,NON-ACTIONABLE
" the problem if we limit the size on options to being what size is offered on the swap hedge, we will not be able to offer adequate size on the options",NON-ACTIONABLE
"optimally, i think we want to offer a minimum size of 100 across all strikes",NON-ACTIONABLE
"if the swap is 4/.5, one a day up, and someone buys half a day, making the market, 4/.5 one a day by half a day, the size offered on a 10 cent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts, a much smaller size than most people want to trade",NON-ACTIONABLE
"if we restrict to strikes with a lower delta, we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a market in options that have open eol interest that have moved closer to the money",NON-ACTIONABLE
"thus if the front swap on eol is 4/.5 one a day by half a day, the input into the option calculator is .75/.75, 100 up",NON-ACTIONABLE
"although striking on the mid-market is probably easier for the trader, i actually think striking in five cent increments makes more sense",NON-ACTIONABLE

" unfortunately, mathematical analysis of skew is extremely hard to do",NON-ACTIONABLE
the question is why does skew exist and does the market do a proper job of correcting for violations of the black scholes model,NON-ACTIONABLE
"in my mind, there are three big reasons for skew",NON-ACTIONABLE
one is that the assumption of stochastic volatility as a function of price level gets violated,NON-ACTIONABLE
commodities tend to have long range trading ranges that exist due to the economics of supply and elasticity of the demand curve,NON-ACTIONABLE
nat gas tends to be relatively stable when we are in that historical pricing environment,NON-ACTIONABLE
"an options trader wants to be long vol outside the trading range, believing that a breakout of the range leads to volatility while trying to find new equilibrium",NON-ACTIONABLE
supports a vol smile theory,NON-ACTIONABLE
"in aition, in some commodities realized vol is a function of price level",NON-ACTIONABLE
nat gas historically is more volatile at $5 than at $4 and more volatile at $4 than $,NON-ACTIONABLE
thus there has been a tendency for all calls to have positive skew and all puts except weenies to have negative skew,NON-ACTIONABLE
the market certainly trades this way as vol has a tendency to come off in a declining market and increase in a rising market,NON-ACTIONABLE
"to test, regress 15 day realized vol versus price level and see if there is any correlation",NON-ACTIONABLE
"second reason is heptocurtosis, fatter tails than lognormal distribution predicts",NON-ACTIONABLE
supports vol smile theory,NON-ACTIONABLE
easy to test how your market compares by plotting historical one day lognormal returns versus expected distribution,NON-ACTIONABLE
"third, is just supply and demand",NON-ACTIONABLE
"in a market where spec players are bearish, put skew tends to get bid as vol players require more insurance premium to a incremetal risk to the book",NON-ACTIONABLE
crude market tends to have strong put skew and weak fences,NON-ACTIONABLE
"if you believe vol is stochastic in the region of prices where the fence strikes are, can be profitable to take other side of trade",NON-ACTIONABLE

"that's just destruction and does not include new production, if any",NON-ACTIONABLE
"further pira estimates that march destruction will be about half of more production, 2 bcf/d more gas generation demand",NON-ACTIONABLE

video conference facilities will also be set up at the nymex office in houston for those who wish to participate there,NON-ACTIONABLE
the agenda is attached,NON-ACTIONABLE
"- options advisory committee may 31, 200.doc ",NON-ACTIONABLE
attached is a suggestion for how such a system might work,NON-ACTIONABLE
it builds on offset to last trade functionality,NON-ACTIONABLE
"as intensity increases, the spread increases",NON-ACTIONABLE
"as bias increases, the offset increases",NON-ACTIONABLE
measured as a moving average over the last [intensity factor] transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction tibco messages for the product,NON-ACTIONABLE
"obviously, the lower the intensity calculation, the higher the transaction flow",NON-ACTIONABLE
therefore a high intensity number indicates low transaction flow,NON-ACTIONABLE
intensity factor - the number of transactions to be included in the moving average intensity calculation,NON-ACTIONABLE
a possible value for this might be [4],NON-ACTIONABLE
#buys - the number of buys which have occurred,NON-ACTIONABLE
#sells - the number of sells which have occured,NON-ACTIONABLE
transaction count - could be either #buys or #sells (whichever last occured).} buy offset - the offset value which will be applied if a buy occurs,NON-ACTIONABLE
sell offset - the offset value which will be applied if a sell occurs,NON-ACTIONABLE
offset reversion ratio (orr)- the amount by which the buy offset should be reduced if a sell occurs (or amount sell offset should be reduced if a buy occurs),NON-ACTIONABLE
a possible value for this might be [.3],NON-ACTIONABLE
"if the application of the orr results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be ",NON-ACTIONABLE
transaction reversion ratio (trr)- the amount by which #buys should be reduced if a sell occurs (or amount #sells should be reduced if a buy occurs),NON-ACTIONABLE
a possible value for this might be [.3],NON-ACTIONABLE
"if the application of the trr results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be equal to ",NON-ACTIONABLE
spread minimum - the minimum spread value allowed,NON-ACTIONABLE
a possible value for this might be [.04] spread maximum - the maximum spread value allowed,NON-ACTIONABLE
a possible value for this might be [.50] offset minimum - the minimum offset allowed for both buys and sells,NON-ACTIONABLE
a possible value for this might be [0],NON-ACTIONABLE
offset maximum -the maximum offset allowed for both buys and sells,NON-ACTIONABLE
a possible value for this might be [.50] initial offset - the buy and sell offset used when the program is started initial spread - the spread used when the program is started spread-offset minimum - the minimum amount by which spread must exceed offset,NON-ACTIONABLE
prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer,NON-ACTIONABLE
"a possible value for this might be [.01] dead interval - the period of time which must pass before the program will recalculate the above criteria, if no transactions have taken place during the dead interval",NON-ACTIONABLE
a possible value for this might be [240] seconds,NON-ACTIONABLE
program outputs the program should output the following variables as a result of combining spread (integer) - as per current stack manager offset (integer) - as per current stack manager suspension (boolean) - whether or not the product should be suspended,NON-ACTIONABLE
this relationship would be defined with intensity formulas and transaction formulas,NON-ACTIONABLE
"every time a transaction occurs, or a dead interval passes, the criteria will be recalculated and the user-defined formulas will be reviewed by the program",NON-ACTIONABLE
"note also that #buys and #sells are not intended to be an absolute count, but rather are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently occured",NON-ACTIONABLE
"in this example, all constants and formulae are editable by the user through the gui",NON-ACTIONABLE
"the price checks will be against prices input by the trader (not relative price movements, but actual price)",NON-ACTIONABLE
there should be both maximum and minimum price checks (e.g,NON-ACTIONABLE
gas is trading at $.5,NON-ACTIONABLE
the notification levels could be $8 at the top end and $2 at the bottom end),NON-ACTIONABLE
offset checks will only be against a maximum value,NON-ACTIONABLE

"it was trading equivalent of 180 on access, down 40+ from this morning",NON-ACTIONABLE
"certainly if we are entering a period of bearish to neutral trade, h/j will get whacked",NON-ACTIONABLE
"if h settles $20, that spread is probably worth $1",NON-ACTIONABLE
h 20 call was trading for 55 on monday,NON-ACTIONABLE
today it was 10/1,NON-ACTIONABLE
the market's view of probability of h going crazy has certainly changed in past 48 hours and that has to be reflected in h/j,NON-ACTIONABLE

we have also summarized our windows 2000 development and certification methodology which is actually a two-phase approach,NON-ACTIONABLE
"the most critical phase, which ensures win2k compatibility and support and includes customer testing, has been completed",NON-ACTIONABLE
the win2k agents are ga for both control-m (scheduling) and control-sa (security),NON-ACTIONABLE
this phase follows the win2k initial release as ms certification focuses on meeting certain microsoft standards and not the application's functionality - ability to work correctly in the control-m environment,NON-ACTIONABLE
it is my understanding that one of the reasons control-m is being considered as a replacement for sys*admiral is due to the problems you are experiencing with their ms certified release,NON-ACTIONABLE
earlier this year we met with philippe bibi and reviewed bmc's win2k development plans,NON-ACTIONABLE
would it be helpful to set up a similar meeting with an executive from our product marketing group to discuss these in more detail,NON-ACTIONABLE

"i just received the following update from rusty cheves, reconfirming that control-m continues to run smoothly since we made the database changes",NON-ACTIONABLE
thanks rob for all the hard work last week,NON-ACTIONABLE
it seems as we have finally got this thing running smoothly,NON-ACTIONABLE
after extending the database and troubleshooting which log files were filling up we now can eval till out hearts content,NON-ACTIONABLE
"thanks, ,original message rob - where are we with the win2k issue ",NON-ACTIONABLE
"original ,hi larry, following is ronnie sapp's summary of the problem resolution for the control-m installation problems and the reliability and scalability results attained",NON-ACTIONABLE
it now appears that most of the problems were caused by the setup of the oracle database,NON-ACTIONABLE
"once we left thursday evening and through the following day, schedule-m worked flawlessly",NON-ACTIONABLE
"the new day process was last measured taking less than five minutes for 960 jobs and we approximated job volumes 14,500 per day",NON-ACTIONABLE
this demonstrates the reliability and scalability of control-m when installed properly,NON-ACTIONABLE
"larry, below is the recap we talked about",NON-ACTIONABLE
there were 2 outstanding issues,NON-ACTIONABLE
1) new day process running 2-5 hrs,NON-ACTIONABLE
"2) jobs not running, they were all in blue or white status",NON-ACTIONABLE
issue number 1 was resolved the day before i arrived by tech support working with rusty,NON-ACTIONABLE
also the log & stat files were extremely small,NON-ACTIONABLE
"these files were cleaned out by rusty, however were never increased or set to truncate in oracle",NON-ACTIONABLE
they will fill up again,NON-ACTIONABLE
issue number 2 - according to a diagnostic report the agent machine lost connection with the nis server for a greater period of time than what the default settings were set,NON-ACTIONABLE
the agent is set to retry every 120 seconds up to 12 times,NON-ACTIONABLE
"after this period, manual activation is required",NON-ACTIONABLE
i signed on as ctmagent user and ran ag_menu,NON-ACTIONABLE
ran option 2 which showed the nis as down,NON-ACTIONABLE
i then signed on as the control-m user and ran ctm_menu,NON-ACTIONABLE
"selected 7 - agent status, selected 2 - list all agent platforms unavailable",NON-ACTIONABLE
agent on bmc was in unavailable status,NON-ACTIONABLE
next selected option 3 - change agent platform to available status,NON-ACTIONABLE
cleaned up 2 erroneous agent names defined to control-m/server,NON-ACTIONABLE
i also ran a trouble shooting report which produced a file (/var/home/ctlm00/report.1116001128) from this file we could tell when the log filed filled up and when the agent stopped,NON-ACTIONABLE
i set up 500 jobs to run daily on bmc with multiple dependencies,NON-ACTIONABLE
all ran ok,NON-ACTIONABLE
i set up aprox,NON-ACTIONABLE
another 150 cyclic jobs with dependencies to run on ocsdev-,NON-ACTIONABLE
they failed due to not using the correct owner,NON-ACTIONABLE
rusty knows what the correct owner should be,NON-ACTIONABLE
i believed i used ctlm0,NON-ACTIONABLE
new day process ran for approx,NON-ACTIONABLE
"right before leaving rusty ran a clean_db script, which resulted in cleaning out the entire database",NON-ACTIONABLE
in less than 5 minutes all was ok,NON-ACTIONABLE
when i left there were approx,NON-ACTIONABLE
900 jobs running,NON-ACTIONABLE
of those approx,NON-ACTIONABLE
"400 jobs were running cyclic, every 2 minutes",NON-ACTIONABLE
which meant on a daily basis approx,NON-ACTIONABLE
"14,500 jobs ran per day",NON-ACTIONABLE
"larry, i know you asked for some type of hardware recommendations",NON-ACTIONABLE
these is something that's very subjective,NON-ACTIONABLE
as with almost any software the more memory and faster cpu the better,NON-ACTIONABLE
"how many jobs per day, today, near future, etc",NON-ACTIONABLE
how many users of ecs,NON-ACTIONABLE
how many servers,NON-ACTIONABLE
in your test environment you should be able to run 2000 jobs without a major problem,NON-ACTIONABLE
"your ecs nt box is on the small size, at least in the memory area",NON-ACTIONABLE
so your responses might not be as fast as desired,NON-ACTIONABLE
therefore database tuning is always recommended,NON-ACTIONABLE

"in brief, the deal is a fixed price one, basis tco (67% of the volumes) and cng (33%) with a fixed price nymex component as well",NON-ACTIONABLE
it will settle against the inside ferc indices for both locations,NON-ACTIONABLE
"the term of the deal is from december, 2000 to december 201",NON-ACTIONABLE
"the volumes decline throughout the term from roughly 22,000 mmbtu/d to 13,000 mmbtu/d",NON-ACTIONABLE

 i'm not sure what is happening on my position,NON-ACTIONABLE
it may have to do with how you shaped the forward vol and price curves at each level,NON-ACTIONABLE
john enron north america corp,NON-ACTIONABLE
the below file shows the results of the two stress test requested,NON-ACTIONABLE
"under the $7 dollar stress, nymex curve was shifted to $7 dollars with all other price curves proportionally shifted",NON-ACTIONABLE
"under the $9 dollar test, not only were the price curves shifted, but volatilites were stressed as well with nymex volatility going to 100% and all other vol locations being raised accordingly",NON-ACTIONABLE
"$7 dollar stress only raised var by 79% $9 dollar stress raised var by 134% it is interesting to note that with the seven dollar stress, var on the financial desk actually decreased",NON-ACTIONABLE
"this would seem to imply that up to the seven dollar strike, the financial desk is long gamma (which overall reduces risk)",NON-ACTIONABLE
"but between the seven dollar and nine dollar strike, it appears that the desk becomes short gamma, thereby acceralatering the amount of risk and increasing var by 74%",NON-ACTIONABLE
frank attached below are the $7 and $9 stresses that were run at the request of lavo ($7) and arnold ($9),NON-ACTIONABLE
i ran the results against the agg-iv portfolio,NON-ACTIONABLE

"several new initiatives being exchanging call options on crude oil for airline tickets (craig breslau, originator) transacting financial swaps on line (larry gagliardi, originator) creating a weather derivative product for the airline industry (mark tawney and gary taylor, originators) outsourcing continental's antifreeze and plastics risks by hedging these products with enron (alan engberg, originator) ron howard, vice president, food services larry kellner, chief financial officer greg hartford, vice president, fuel management company jeff misner, vice president and treasurer (tentative) jeff shankman, president and coo, enron global markets john nowlan, vice president, enron global markets craig breslau, vice president, enron north america mark tawney, director, enron global markets (tentative) (developed through conversations with alan engberg, larry gagliardi, gary taylor, craig breslau, tracy ramsey and lucy ortiz.) current enron verifiable spend on continental airline tickets was approximately $40 million in fy 1999 and $1.5 million for the first six months of 200",NON-ACTIONABLE

"could also supply continental with jet fuel physical in the following locations such as the us gulf coast, new york harbor, the us west coast, and europe",NON-ACTIONABLE
(enron is doing this now with delta airlines in new york harbor),NON-ACTIONABLE
aggregate bad weather above a tolerable level would result in payment from enron to continental,NON-ACTIONABLE
continental airlines clearly has exposure to weather as indicated in their annual reports and periodic press releases - particularly those discussing earnings,NON-ACTIONABLE
it is extremely difficult to envision the perfect weather hedge for all of continental's weather related exposure,NON-ACTIONABLE
"however, it is not difficult to envision simple ways to reduce a large portion of it",NON-ACTIONABLE

their purchase contracts are linked to the index used for hedging) and associated reduction in volatility of cash flows hedged 100% of their 4 million pound polystyrene exposure,NON-ACTIONABLE
"since continental has not yet shared the size of their antifreeze buy, engberg cannot comment on the potential value to enron though he is fairly certain it would be much larger than $2 million",NON-ACTIONABLE

attached is a suggestion for how such a system might work,NON-ACTIONABLE
it builds on offset to last trade functionality,NON-ACTIONABLE
"as intensity increases, the spread increases",NON-ACTIONABLE
"as bias increases, the offset increases",NON-ACTIONABLE
measured as a moving average over the last [intensity factor] transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction tibco messages for the product,NON-ACTIONABLE
"obviously, the lower the intensity calculation, the higher the transaction flow",NON-ACTIONABLE
therefore a high intensity number indicates low transaction flow,NON-ACTIONABLE
intensity factor - the number of transactions to be included in the moving average intensity calculation,NON-ACTIONABLE
a possible value for this might be [4],NON-ACTIONABLE
#buys - the number of buys which have occurred,NON-ACTIONABLE
#sells - the number of sells which have occured,NON-ACTIONABLE
transaction count - could be either #buys or #sells (whichever last occured).} buy offset - the offset value which will be applied if a buy occurs,NON-ACTIONABLE
sell offset - the offset value which will be applied if a sell occurs,NON-ACTIONABLE
offset reversion ratio (orr)- the amount by which the buy offset should be reduced if a sell occurs (or amount sell offset should be reduced if a buy occurs),NON-ACTIONABLE
a possible value for this might be [.3],NON-ACTIONABLE
"if the application of the orr results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be ",NON-ACTIONABLE
transaction reversion ratio (trr)- the amount by which #buys should be reduced if a sell occurs (or amount #sells should be reduced if a buy occurs),NON-ACTIONABLE
a possible value for this might be [.3],NON-ACTIONABLE
"if the application of the trr results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be equal to ",NON-ACTIONABLE
spread minimum - the minimum spread value allowed,NON-ACTIONABLE
a possible value for this might be [.04] spread maximum - the maximum spread value allowed,NON-ACTIONABLE
a possible value for this might be [.50] offset minimum - the minimum offset allowed for both buys and sells,NON-ACTIONABLE
a possible value for this might be [0],NON-ACTIONABLE
offset maximum -the maximum offset allowed for both buys and sells,NON-ACTIONABLE
a possible value for this might be [.50] initial offset - the buy and sell offset used when the program is started initial spread - the spread used when the program is started spread-offset minimum - the minimum amount by which spread must exceed offset,NON-ACTIONABLE
prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer,NON-ACTIONABLE
"a possible value for this might be [.01] dead interval - the period of time which must pass before the program will recalculate the above criteria, if no transactions have taken place during the dead interval",NON-ACTIONABLE
a possible value for this might be [240] seconds,NON-ACTIONABLE
program outputs the program should output the following variables as a result of combining spread (integer) - as per current stack manager offset (integer) - as per current stack manager suspension (boolean) - whether or not the product should be suspended,NON-ACTIONABLE
this relationship would be defined with intensity formulas and transaction formulas,NON-ACTIONABLE
"every time a transaction occurs, or a dead interval passes, the criteria will be recalculated and the user-defined formulas will be reviewed by the program",NON-ACTIONABLE
"note also that #buys and #sells are not intended to be an absolute count, but rather are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently occured",NON-ACTIONABLE
"in this example, all constants and formulae are editable by the user through the gui",NON-ACTIONABLE
"the price checks will be against prices input by the trader (not relative price movements, but actual price)",NON-ACTIONABLE
there should be both maximum and minimum price checks (e.g,NON-ACTIONABLE
gas is trading at $.5,NON-ACTIONABLE
the notification levels could be $8 at the top end and $2 at the bottom end),NON-ACTIONABLE
offset checks will only be against a maximum value,NON-ACTIONABLE

" unfortunately, mathematical analysis of skew is extremely hard to do",NON-ACTIONABLE
the question is why does skew exist and does the market do a proper job of correcting for violations of the black scholes model,NON-ACTIONABLE
"in my mind, there are three big reasons for skew",NON-ACTIONABLE
one is that the assumption of stochastic volatility as a function of price level gets violated,NON-ACTIONABLE
commodities tend to have long range trading ranges that exist due to the economics of supply and elasticity of the demand curve,NON-ACTIONABLE
nat gas tends to be relatively stable when we are in that historical pricing environment,NON-ACTIONABLE
"an options trader wants to be long vol outside the trading range, believing that a breakout of the range leads to volatility while trying to find new equilibrium",NON-ACTIONABLE
supports a vol smile theory,NON-ACTIONABLE
"in aition, in some commodities realized vol is a function of price level",NON-ACTIONABLE
nat gas historically is more volatile at $5 than at $4 and more volatile at $4 than $,NON-ACTIONABLE
thus there has been a tendency for all calls to have positive skew and all puts except weenies to have negative skew,NON-ACTIONABLE
the market certainly trades this way as vol has a tendency to come off in a declining market and increase in a rising market,NON-ACTIONABLE
"to test, regress 15 day realized vol versus price level and see if there is any correlation",NON-ACTIONABLE
"second reason is heptocurtosis, fatter tails than lognormal distribution predicts",NON-ACTIONABLE
supports vol smile theory,NON-ACTIONABLE
easy to test how your market compares by plotting historical one day lognormal returns versus expected distribution,NON-ACTIONABLE
"third, is just supply and demand",NON-ACTIONABLE
"in a market where spec players are bearish, put skew tends to get bid as vol players require more insurance premium to a incremetal risk to the book",NON-ACTIONABLE
crude market tends to have strong put skew and weak fences,NON-ACTIONABLE
"if you believe vol is stochastic in the region of prices where the fence strikes are, can be profitable to take other side of trade",NON-ACTIONABLE
