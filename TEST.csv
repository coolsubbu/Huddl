attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials jeff dasovich and i prepared,ACTIONABLE,1
the gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees,ACTIONABLE,1
"he also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of california consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power (which he estimates at 3000mw)",ACTIONABLE,1
he foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by '02 and provide some political cover,ACTIONABLE,1
"he seemed interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a goal of x000 mw of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate analysts and other ""nonadvocates"" to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities",ACTIONABLE,1
state may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a "couple" of generation plants,ACTIONABLE,1
the gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases,ACTIONABLE,1
utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus basis to consumers,ACTIONABLE,1
take state lands gas royalties in kind,ACTIONABLE,1
empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time,ACTIONABLE,1
condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state,ACTIONABLE,1
either eliminate the iso or sharply curtail its function he wants to hear more about how nordpool works(jeff- someone in schroeder's group should be able to help out here),ACTIONABLE,1
we made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators,ACTIONABLE,1
thoughts and get them to kari) he wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload not just the 5 one year strips,ACTIONABLE,1
he would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal,ACTIONABLE,1

bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8th deadline due to lackof support sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for thebond issuance/bridge loan by the may 8th deadline,ACTIONABLE,1
"however, it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place",ACTIONABLE,1
"sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8th, having a bond issuance by july 1st will be very difficult",ACTIONABLE,1
"however, sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen, currently in ab 8x",ACTIONABLE,1
"senator bowen's language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy). according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature, republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund",ACTIONABLE,1
" key points of the bridge financing lehman brothers$.0 b bear stearns$625 m tax-exempt rate.77% current projected for more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510 bill sb 6x passed the senate yesterday, but little can be done at this time the senate passed sb 6x yesterday, which authorizes $5 billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority",ACTIONABLE,1
"without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor has negotiated, the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support",ACTIONABLE,1
"according to sources, the state has yet to sign the mou with socal, though socal has signed it",ACTIONABLE,1
the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass,ACTIONABLE,1
"if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou, socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash",ACTIONABLE,1
" the second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond issuance, would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31x (bridge loan) stating that the dwr would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, then the utilities would receive the residual amount",ACTIONABLE,1
"if this language is included and passed by the legislature, it appears likely that socal will likely file forbankruptcy",ACTIONABLE,1

"if not, can you have your assistant call me with id's and passwords",ACTIONABLE,1
 please respond to typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or llc) general partner,ACTIONABLE,1
each of the individual investors and all of the principals in creekside would also personally guarantee the loans,ACTIONABLE,1
"unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to creekside builders, llc",ACTIONABLE,1
"with a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately .25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees",ACTIONABLE,1
"equity at improvement loan once the site plan is approved by the city of austin, the city will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the ""fiscals""",ACTIONABLE,1
"this would produce a loan amount of $15,000 on $20,000 per lot",ACTIONABLE,1
"even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent",ACTIONABLE,1
"the engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement",ACTIONABLE,1
"the improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land",ACTIONABLE,1
"this would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,00",ACTIONABLE,1
we expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer,ACTIONABLE,1
"we do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process",ACTIONABLE,1
"the general partner will contract with creekside builders, llc to construct the units and the fee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs",ACTIONABLE,1
"for example, if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership",ACTIONABLE,1
"finally, cb will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others",ACTIONABLE,1

"sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8th, having a bond issuance by july 1st will be very difficult",ACTIONABLE,1
"sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they will support the bond issuance to go forward",ACTIONABLE,1
"however, sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen, currently in ab 8x",ACTIONABLE,1
"according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature, republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund",ACTIONABLE,1
"key points of the bridge financing lehman brothers $.0 b bear stearns $625 m tax-exempt rate .77% current projected for more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510 bill sb 6x passed the senate yesterday, but little can be done at this time the senate passed sb 6x yesterday, which authorizes $5 billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority",ACTIONABLE,1
"without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor has negotiated, the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support",ACTIONABLE,1
"according to sources, the state has yet to sign the mou with socal, though socal has signed it",ACTIONABLE,1
the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass,ACTIONABLE,1
"if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou, socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash",ACTIONABLE,1
"the second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond issuance, would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31x (bridge loan) stating that the dwr would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, then the utilities would receive the residual amount",ACTIONABLE,1

"he also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of california consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power (which he estimates at 3000mw)",ACTIONABLE,1
he foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by '02 and provide some political cover,ACTIONABLE,1
"he seemed interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a goal of x000 mw of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate analysts and other ""nonadvocates"" to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities",ACTIONABLE,1
state may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a "couple" of generation plants,ACTIONABLE,1
the gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases,ACTIONABLE,1
utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus basis to consumers,ACTIONABLE,1

each of the individual investors and all of the principals in creekside would also personally guarantee the loans,ACTIONABLE,1
"unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to creekside builders, llc",ACTIONABLE,1
"with a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately .25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees",ACTIONABLE,1
"equity at improvement loan once the site plan is approved by the city of austin, the city will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the ""fiscals""",ACTIONABLE,1

"even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent",ACTIONABLE,1
"the engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement",ACTIONABLE,1
"the improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land",ACTIONABLE,1
"this would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,00",ACTIONABLE,1
we expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer,ACTIONABLE,1
"we do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process",ACTIONABLE,1
"the general partner will contract with creekside builders, llc to construct the units and the fee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs",ACTIONABLE,1
"for example, if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership",ACTIONABLE,1

"unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to creekside builders, llc",ACTIONABLE,1
"with a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately .25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees",ACTIONABLE,1
"equity at improvement loan once the site plan is approved by the city of austin, the city will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the ""fiscals""",ACTIONABLE,1

attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials jeff dasovich and i prepared,ACTIONABLE,1
the gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees,ACTIONABLE,1
"he also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of california consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power (which he estimates at 3000mw)",ACTIONABLE,1
he foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by '02 and provide some political cover,ACTIONABLE,1
"he seemed interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a goal of x000 mw of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate analysts and other ""nonadvocates"" to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities",ACTIONABLE,1
state may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a "couple" of generation plants,ACTIONABLE,1
the gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases,ACTIONABLE,1
utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus basis to consumers,ACTIONABLE,1
take state lands gas royalties in kind,ACTIONABLE,1
empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time,ACTIONABLE,1
condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state,ACTIONABLE,1
either eliminate the iso or sharply curtail its function he wants to hear more about how nordpool works(jeff- someone in schroeder's group should be able to help out here),ACTIONABLE,1
we made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators,ACTIONABLE,1
thoughts and get them to kari) he wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload not just the 5 one year strips,ACTIONABLE,1
he would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal,ACTIONABLE,1
he wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues,ACTIONABLE,1
where did you get these amounts,ACTIONABLE,1
do not evict this tenant for being unclean!,ACTIONABLE,1
that will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money and time remodeling,ACTIONABLE,1
i would rather try and deal with this tenant by first asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like leaky pipes,ACTIONABLE,1
"if that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the apartment and charge them for the labor",ACTIONABLE,1
then we will perform monthly inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property,ACTIONABLE,1

"traders put the two together, anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights",ACTIONABLE,1
"he had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality",ACTIONABLE,1
"""it's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what we are reporting,"" mcgill said",ACTIONABLE,1
"closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes",ACTIONABLE,1
"most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging a sort of price insurance that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared",ACTIONABLE,1
"""there's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to change,"" said ed krapels, director of gas power services for energy security analysis inc., an energy consulting firm in wakefield, mass",ACTIONABLE,1
"the sunday collection is down, said fraser, who might have to forgo part of his salary",ACTIONABLE,1
wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per thousand cubic feet a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile to drill for gas,ACTIONABLE,1
"by spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter",ACTIONABLE,1
"but if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to know much about gas or whatever commodity they're trading",ACTIONABLE,1
that leverage as to their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time,ACTIONABLE,1
utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter,ACTIONABLE,1
but some utility executives didn't share that view,ACTIONABLE,1
just passing through some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers,ACTIONABLE,1
"sheila lumpe, chairwoman of the missouri public service commission, said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve energy",ACTIONABLE,1
it waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs,ACTIONABLE,1
now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills,ACTIONABLE,1
and regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs,ACTIONABLE,1
"on friday, doug micheel, senior counsel of the missouri office of the public counsel, said his office would ask the missouri public service commission to perform an emergency audit of missouri gas energy's gas purchasing practices",ACTIONABLE,1

"however, it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place",ACTIONABLE,1

"we can have the position and p&l reports show the results of the learner's decisions in previous periods, which will allow the learner move forward in time with wrong answers",ACTIONABLE,1
this will achieve our goal of giving the learners "more rope" and letting them see the results of their mistakes,ACTIONABLE,1
"we will be able to provide feedback on cumulative p&l and positions, but not about specific actions the learner took in a previous period",ACTIONABLE,1
"we will not, for example, be able to say things like ""in november, when we were headed into a cold winter, you chose to withdraw gas",ACTIONABLE,1
what you should have done was." we cannot save the p&l and position numbers,ACTIONABLE,1
"this means that if the learner leaves the simulation, returns to the main menu, or experiences a computer crash, his decisions will not be saved and he will need to start over at time period one",ACTIONABLE,1
"we cannot have the learner calculate p&l on storage costs, transportation costs, or hedging instruments",ACTIONABLE,1
i believe these tasks will be actually better if we don't have the learner calculate p&l because he has already calculated p&l numerous times in the structurer/customer scenarios and conversion and arbitrage scenarios,ACTIONABLE,1
we cannot export price numbers into excel because the indeliq framework does not support the downloading of data into external applications,ACTIONABLE,1
we can also try to somehow allow the learner to make the mistake of using future prices instead of discounted prices,ACTIONABLE,1

the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass,ACTIONABLE,1
"if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou, socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash",ACTIONABLE,1

"your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., march 2001 vs",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
march 2000) was absolutely correct,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"at this point, it appears that demand over the last 12 months in the caiso control area, after adjusting for temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"this translates into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 mwa for last month (march 2001) as compared with the previous year",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"looking forward into the summer, i believe that we will see further voluntary reductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts)",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"other forecasters (e.g., pira) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 mwa (making total year-on-year reduction 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in june",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"this scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"given that the 6% decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, i think that it is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last year",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"note that all the numbers i am reporting here are for the caiso control area only, which represents about 89% of total calif load, or 36-37% of wscc (u.s.) summer load",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"i think it is reasonable to assume that the non-iso portion of calif (i.e., ladwp and iid) will see similar reductions in demand",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"as for the rest of the wscc, that is a much more difficult call",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"as you are aware, the pacific nw has already seen about 2,000 mwa of aluminum smelter load come off since dec, and this load is expected to stay off at least through sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if bpa gets its wish)",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
this figure represents approx 4% of the non-calif wscc,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
several mining operations in the sw and rockies have recently announced that they are sharply curtailing production,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"while the rest of the wscc may not see the 10%+ reductions that i am expecting in calif, i think we could easily expect an aitional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 mwa, of further demand reduction in the non-calif wscc for this summer",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"this would bring the total reduction for the wscc, including the 2,000 mwa aluminum load we have already seen, to around 6,500-7,000 mwa when compared with last summer",NON-ACTIONABLE,0

"your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., march 2001 vs",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
march 2000) was absolutely correct,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"at this point, it appears that demand over the last 12 months in the caiso control area, after adjusting for temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"this translates into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 mwa for last month (march 2001) as compared with the previous year",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"looking forward into the summer, i believe that we will see further voluntary reductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts)",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"other forecasters (e.g., pira) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 mwa (making total year-on-year reduction 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in june",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"this scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"given that the 6% decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, i think that it is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last year",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"note that all the numbers i am reporting here are for the caiso control area only, which represents about 89% of total calif load, or 36-37% of wscc (u.s.) summer load",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"i think it is reasonable to assume that the non-iso portion of calif (i.e., ladwp and iid) will see similar reductions in demand",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"as for the rest of the wscc, that is a much more difficult call",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"as you are aware, the pacific nw has already seen about 2,000 mwa of aluminum smelter load come off since dec, and this load is expected to stay off at least through sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if bpa gets its wish)",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
this figure represents approx 4% of the non-calif wscc,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
several mining operations in the sw and rockies have recently announced that they are sharply curtailing production,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"while the rest of the wscc may not see the 10%+ reductions that i am expecting in calif, i think we could easily expect an aitional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 mwa, of further demand reduction in the non-calif wscc for this summer",NON-ACTIONABLE,0

 section .3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum distribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% penalty,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
this provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision of the plan,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
it also states that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee receives the written request of the participant,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
in my case this would be asof september 30th,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"their reading yields a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the phantom stock account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of enron corp",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"shares in the account as of september 30, 200",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
their justification is that in several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated that the distributions of the phantom stock account shall be made in shares of enron corp,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
there are two reason that i do not agree with their interpretation,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"first,section .3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the plan."" this indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other sections of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do not apply",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"second, the language in section .3 stating ""a single sum distribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one payment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
the interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section ,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
if that is the case then section .1 should apply,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
this section does provide for the phantom stock account to be paid in shares,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"however, it states ""the value of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closing price of enron corp",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"common stock on the january 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of enron corp common stock"".this would result in approximately .3 shares to be distributed for everyshare in the account on january 1, 200",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
although this would be the most beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of enron corp,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"common stock from $83 to $10 per share, this methodology goes beyond section ",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"the calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method ofsection .3plan administratorssection .1 number of shares,600shares,600shares,600 shares relative share price$2.23$8.13 phantom stock value$179,718$548,658 10% penalty-17,972 -600-54,866 value to be distributed$161,746,000 shares$493,792 current stock price$10 distribution$161,746,000 shares,379 shares i believe my interpretation under section .3 is correct and fair",NON-ACTIONABLE,0

"your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., march 2001 vs",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
march 2000) was absolutely correct,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"at this point, it appears that demand over the last 12 months in the caiso control area, after adjusting for temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"this translates into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 mwa for last month (march 2001) as compared with the previous year",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"looking forward into the summer, i believe that we will see further voluntary reductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts)",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"other forecasters (e.g., pira) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 mwa (making total year-on-year reduction 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in june",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"this scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"given that the 6% decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, i think that it is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last year",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"note that all the numbers i am reporting here are for the caiso control area only, which represents about 89% of total calif load, or 36-37% of wscc (u.s.) summer load",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"i think it is reasonable to assume that the non-iso portion of calif (i.e., ladwp and iid) will see similar reductions in demand",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"as for the rest of the wscc, that is a much more difficult call",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"as you are aware, the pacific nw has already seen about 2,000 mwa of aluminum smelter load come off since dec, and this load is expected to stay off at least through sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if bpa gets its wish)",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
this figure represents approx 4% of the non-calif wscc,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
several mining operations in the sw and rockies have recently announced that they are sharply curtailing production,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"while the rest of the wscc may not see the 10%+ reductions that i am expecting in calif, i think we could easily expect an aitional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 mwa, of further demand reduction in the non-calif wscc for this summer",NON-ACTIONABLE,0

 section .3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum distribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% penalty,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
this provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision of the plan,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
it also states that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee receives the written request of the participant,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
in my case this would be asof september 30th,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"their reading yields a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the phantom stock account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of enron corp",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"shares in the account as of september 30, 200",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
their justification is that in several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated that the distributions of the phantom stock account shall be made in shares of enron corp,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
there are two reason that i do not agree with their interpretation,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"first,section .3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the plan."" this indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other sections of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do not apply",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"second, the language in section .3 stating ""a single sum distribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one payment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
the interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section ,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
if that is the case then section .1 should apply,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
this section does provide for the phantom stock account to be paid in shares,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"however, it states ""the value of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closing price of enron corp",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"common stock on the january 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of enron corp common stock"".this would result in approximately .3 shares to be distributed for everyshare in the account on january 1, 200",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
although this would be the most beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of enron corp,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"common stock from $83 to $10 per share, this methodology goes beyond section ",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"the calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method ofsection .3plan administratorssection .1 number of shares,600shares,600shares,600 shares relative share price$2.23$8.13 phantom stock value$179,718$548,658 10% penalty-17,972 -600-54,866 value to be distributed$161,746,000 shares$493,792 current stock price$10 distribution$161,746,000 shares,379 shares i believe my interpretation under section .3 is correct and fair",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
if the administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7.1 should apply,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
the current interpretation of the plan administrators is a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout,NON-ACTIONABLE,0

this is the methodology described in section ,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
tom martin and scott neal share the above concerns,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"phillip original message for purposes of an accelerated distribution from the psa, a ""single sum distribution,"" in section .2 means that a psa account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
section .2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee receives the written request of the participant,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
a psa account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"aitionally, any portion of a psa balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under sections .5 and .6 and exhibit a of the plan",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
this section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of psa balances created with deferrals of restricted stock,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"the plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election",NON-ACTIONABLE,0

"phillip et al., the west",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., march 2001 vs",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
march 2000) was absolutely correct,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"at this point, it appears that demand over the last 12 months in the caiso control area, after adjusting for temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"this translates into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 mwa for last month (march 2001) as compared with the previous year",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"looking forward into the summer, i believe that we will see further voluntary reductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts)",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"other forecasters (e.g., pira) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 mwa (making total year-on-year reduction 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in june",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"this scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"given that the 6% decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, i think that it is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last year",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"note that all the numbers i am reporting here are for the caiso control area only, which represents about 89% of total calif load, or 36-37% of wscc (u.s.) summer load",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"i think it is reasonable to assume that the non-iso portion of calif (i.e., ladwp and iid) will see similar reductions in demand",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"as for the rest of the wscc, that is a much more difficult call",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"as you are aware, the pacific nw has already seen about 2,000 mwa of aluminum smelter load come off since dec, and this load is expected to stay off at least through sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if bpa gets its wish)",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
this figure represents approx 4% of the non-calif wscc,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
several mining operations in the sw and rockies have recently announced that they are sharply curtailing production,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"while the rest of the wscc may not see the 10%+ reductions that i am expecting in calif, i think we could easily expect an aitional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 mwa, of further demand reduction in the non-calif wscc for this summer",NON-ACTIONABLE,0

oh and that certainly is a pretty design you a to your emails,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
i really liked the commercials about specifics (i.e,NON-ACTIONABLE,0

still not quite sure what was going on there,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
ode was a bit too idealistic,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
the campaign in general was very different than previous,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
but i guess you know that and that's the point,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"again, i think the commercials that showed why we are the most innovative were very impressive",NON-ACTIONABLE,0

the below file shows the results of the two stress test requested,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"under the $7 dollar stress, nymex curve was shifted to $7 dollars with all other price curves proportionally shifted",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"under the $9 dollar test, not only were the price curves shifted, but volatilites were stressed as well with nymex volatility going to 100% and all other vol locations being raised accordingly",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"$7 dollar stress only raised var by 79% $9 dollar stress raised var by 134% it is interesting to note that with the seven dollar stress, var on the financial desk actually decreased",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"this would seem to imply that up to the seven dollar strike, the financial desk is long gamma (which overall reduces risk)",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"but between the seven dollar and nine dollar strike, it appears that the desk becomes short gamma, thereby acceralatering the amount of risk and increasing var by 74%",NON-ACTIONABLE,0

this book is a good candidate for a systematic review of the var process,NON-ACTIONABLE,0

this ff vol is also much different from the previous day number producing a big jump in var,NON-ACTIONABLE,0

 sorry for my cryptic answer in regards to the lng deal on friday; i was a bit confused by the question,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"in terms of the gas pricing, this is a deal that should be done",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
market conditions are very conducive to hedging a fair amount of the gas,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"obviously, a deal this size would require enron to wear a considerable amount of the risk in the short term, but the risk-reward of the position looks very favorable",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
i am certainly willing to sign off on this deal around the $.00 level,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
" the problem if we limit the size on options to being what size is offered on the swap hedge, we will not be able to offer adequate size on the options",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"optimally, i think we want to offer a minimum size of 100 across all strikes",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"if the swap is 4/.5, one a day up, and someone buys half a day, making the market, 4/.5 one a day by half a day, the size offered on a 10 cent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts, a much smaller size than most people want to trade",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"if we restrict to strikes with a lower delta, we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a market in options that have open eol interest that have moved closer to the money",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"thus if the front swap on eol is 4/.5 one a day by half a day, the input into the option calculator is .75/.75, 100 up",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"although striking on the mid-market is probably easier for the trader, i actually think striking in five cent increments makes more sense",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
it allows people to trade out of the position on eol,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"secondly, i would anticipate non-volatility driven option traders may elect to sell either just the put or call in this scenario depending on their view of market direction.",NON-ACTIONABLE,0

"first, what happens if the delta of the option is greater than the size of the hedge offered on eol",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"second, what strike are strales traded at",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
are they set at the nearest 5 cent interval or are they mid-market of the eol quote?,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
 the increase in position and subsequent position limit violation was due to two factors,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"first, a long position was moved into the long-term exotics book due to the nature of the position",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
i am currently using the ltx to hold longer-term strategic positions,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
the large increase in position is a reflection of my view of the market,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"second, a large customer transaction originated by fred lagrasta's group was transacted at the end of the day monday and was not able to be hedged until this morning",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
hence a large position increase occurred for yesterday's position and a corresponding decrease occurred today,NON-ACTIONABLE,0

" unfortunately, mathematical analysis of skew is extremely hard to do",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
the question is why does skew exist and does the market do a proper job of correcting for violations of the black scholes model,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"in my mind, there are three big reasons for skew",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
one is that the assumption of stochastic volatility as a function of price level gets violated,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
commodities tend to have long range trading ranges that exist due to the economics of supply and elasticity of the demand curve,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
nat gas tends to be relatively stable when we are in that historical pricing environment,NON-ACTIONABLE,0

"in aition, in some commodities realized vol is a function of price level",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
nat gas historically is more volatile at $5 than at $4 and more volatile at $4 than $,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
thus there has been a tendency for all calls to have positive skew and all puts except weenies to have negative skew,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
the market certainly trades this way as vol has a tendency to come off in a declining market and increase in a rising market,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"to test, regress 15 day realized vol versus price level and see if there is any correlation",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"second reason is heptocurtosis, fatter tails than lognormal distribution predicts",NON-ACTIONABLE,0

it builds on offset to last trade functionality,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"as intensity increases, the spread increases",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"as bias increases, the offset increases",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
measured as a moving average over the last [intensity factor] transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction tibco messages for the product,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"obviously, the lower the intensity calculation, the higher the transaction flow",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
therefore a high intensity number indicates low transaction flow,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
intensity factor - the number of transactions to be included in the moving average intensity calculation,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
a possible value for this might be [4],NON-ACTIONABLE,0
#buys - the number of buys which have occurred,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
#sells - the number of sells which have occured,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
transaction count - could be either #buys or #sells (whichever last occured).} buy offset - the offset value which will be applied if a buy occurs,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
sell offset - the offset value which will be applied if a sell occurs,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
offset reversion ratio (orr)- the amount by which the buy offset should be reduced if a sell occurs (or amount sell offset should be reduced if a buy occurs),NON-ACTIONABLE,0
a possible value for this might be [.3],NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"if the application of the orr results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be ",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
transaction reversion ratio (trr)- the amount by which #buys should be reduced if a sell occurs (or amount #sells should be reduced if a buy occurs),NON-ACTIONABLE,0
a possible value for this might be [.3],NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"if the application of the trr results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be equal to ",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
spread minimum - the minimum spread value allowed,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
a possible value for this might be [.04] spread maximum - the maximum spread value allowed,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
a possible value for this might be [.50] offset minimum - the minimum offset allowed for both buys and sells,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
a possible value for this might be [0],NON-ACTIONABLE,0
offset maximum -the maximum offset allowed for both buys and sells,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
a possible value for this might be [.50] initial offset - the buy and sell offset used when the program is started initial spread - the spread used when the program is started spread-offset minimum - the minimum amount by which spread must exceed offset,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"a possible value for this might be [.01] dead interval - the period of time which must pass before the program will recalculate the above criteria, if no transactions have taken place during the dead interval",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
a possible value for this might be [240] seconds,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
program outputs the program should output the following variables as a result of combining spread (integer) - as per current stack manager offset (integer) - as per current stack manager suspension (boolean) - whether or not the product should be suspended,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
this relationship would be defined with intensity formulas and transaction formulas,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"every time a transaction occurs, or a dead interval passes, the criteria will be recalculated and the user-defined formulas will be reviewed by the program",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"note also that #buys and #sells are not intended to be an absolute count, but rather are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently occured",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"in this example, all constants and formulae are editable by the user through the gui",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"the price checks will be against prices input by the trader (not relative price movements, but actual price)",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
there should be both maximum and minimum price checks (e.g,NON-ACTIONABLE,0

 the short answer is that trucking lng to california is not a feasible option for endusers other than companies with lng-fueled vehicle fleets,NON-ACTIONABLE,0

we have also summarized our windows 2000 development and certification methodology which is actually a two-phase approach,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"the most critical phase, which ensures win2k compatibility and support and includes customer testing, has been completed",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
the win2k agents are ga for both control-m (scheduling) and control-sa (security),NON-ACTIONABLE,0
this phase follows the win2k initial release as ms certification focuses on meeting certain microsoft standards and not the application's functionality - ability to work correctly in the control-m environment,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
it is my understanding that one of the reasons control-m is being considered as a replacement for sys*admiral is due to the problems you are experiencing with their ms certified release,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
earlier this year we met with philippe bibi and reviewed bmc's win2k development plans,NON-ACTIONABLE,0

"original ,hi larry, following is ronnie sapp's summary of the problem resolution for the control-m installation problems and the reliability and scalability results attained",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
it now appears that most of the problems were caused by the setup of the oracle database,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"once we left thursday evening and through the following day, schedule-m worked flawlessly",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"the new day process was last measured taking less than five minutes for 960 jobs and we approximated job volumes 14,500 per day",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
this demonstrates the reliability and scalability of control-m when installed properly,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"larry, below is the recap we talked about",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
there were 2 outstanding issues,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
1) new day process running 2-5 hrs,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"2) jobs not running, they were all in blue or white status",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
issue number 1 was resolved the day before i arrived by tech support working with rusty,NON-ACTIONABLE,0

issue number 2 - according to a diagnostic report the agent machine lost connection with the nis server for a greater period of time than what the default settings were set,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
the agent is set to retry every 120 seconds up to 12 times,NON-ACTIONABLE,0

these is something that's very subjective,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
as with almost any software the more memory and faster cpu the better,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"how many jobs per day, today, near future, etc",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
how many users of ecs,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
how many servers,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
in your test environment you should be able to run 2000 jobs without a major problem,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"your ecs nt box is on the small size, at least in the memory area",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
so your responses might not be as fast as desired,NON-ACTIONABLE,0

attached is a suggestion for how such a system might work,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
it builds on offset to last trade functionality,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"as intensity increases, the spread increases",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"as bias increases, the offset increases",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
measured as a moving average over the last [intensity factor] transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction tibco messages for the product,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"obviously, the lower the intensity calculation, the higher the transaction flow",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
therefore a high intensity number indicates low transaction flow,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
intensity factor - the number of transactions to be included in the moving average intensity calculation,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
a possible value for this might be [4],NON-ACTIONABLE,0
#buys - the number of buys which have occurred,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
#sells - the number of sells which have occured,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
transaction count - could be either #buys or #sells (whichever last occured).} buy offset - the offset value which will be applied if a buy occurs,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
sell offset - the offset value which will be applied if a sell occurs,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
offset reversion ratio (orr)- the amount by which the buy offset should be reduced if a sell occurs (or amount sell offset should be reduced if a buy occurs),NON-ACTIONABLE,0
a possible value for this might be [.3],NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"if the application of the orr results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be ",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
transaction reversion ratio (trr)- the amount by which #buys should be reduced if a sell occurs (or amount #sells should be reduced if a buy occurs),NON-ACTIONABLE,0
a possible value for this might be [.3],NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"if the application of the trr results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be equal to ",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
spread minimum - the minimum spread value allowed,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
a possible value for this might be [.04] spread maximum - the maximum spread value allowed,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
a possible value for this might be [.50] offset minimum - the minimum offset allowed for both buys and sells,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
a possible value for this might be [0],NON-ACTIONABLE,0
offset maximum -the maximum offset allowed for both buys and sells,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
a possible value for this might be [.50] initial offset - the buy and sell offset used when the program is started initial spread - the spread used when the program is started spread-offset minimum - the minimum amount by which spread must exceed offset,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"a possible value for this might be [.01] dead interval - the period of time which must pass before the program will recalculate the above criteria, if no transactions have taken place during the dead interval",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
a possible value for this might be [240] seconds,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
program outputs the program should output the following variables as a result of combining spread (integer) - as per current stack manager offset (integer) - as per current stack manager suspension (boolean) - whether or not the product should be suspended,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
this relationship would be defined with intensity formulas and transaction formulas,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"every time a transaction occurs, or a dead interval passes, the criteria will be recalculated and the user-defined formulas will be reviewed by the program",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"note also that #buys and #sells are not intended to be an absolute count, but rather are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently occured",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"in this example, all constants and formulae are editable by the user through the gui",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"the price checks will be against prices input by the trader (not relative price movements, but actual price)",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
there should be both maximum and minimum price checks (e.g,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
gas is trading at $.5,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
the notification levels could be $8 at the top end and $2 at the bottom end),NON-ACTIONABLE,0

" unfortunately, mathematical analysis of skew is extremely hard to do",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
the question is why does skew exist and does the market do a proper job of correcting for violations of the black scholes model,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"in my mind, there are three big reasons for skew",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
one is that the assumption of stochastic volatility as a function of price level gets violated,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
commodities tend to have long range trading ranges that exist due to the economics of supply and elasticity of the demand curve,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
nat gas tends to be relatively stable when we are in that historical pricing environment,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"an options trader wants to be long vol outside the trading range, believing that a breakout of the range leads to volatility while trying to find new equilibrium",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
supports a vol smile theory,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"in aition, in some commodities realized vol is a function of price level",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
nat gas historically is more volatile at $5 than at $4 and more volatile at $4 than $,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
thus there has been a tendency for all calls to have positive skew and all puts except weenies to have negative skew,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
the market certainly trades this way as vol has a tendency to come off in a declining market and increase in a rising market,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"to test, regress 15 day realized vol versus price level and see if there is any correlation",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"second reason is heptocurtosis, fatter tails than lognormal distribution predicts",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
supports vol smile theory,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
easy to test how your market compares by plotting historical one day lognormal returns versus expected distribution,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"third, is just supply and demand",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
"in a market where spec players are bearish, put skew tends to get bid as vol players require more insurance premium to a incremetal risk to the book",NON-ACTIONABLE,0
crude market tends to have strong put skew and weak fences,NON-ACTIONABLE,0
